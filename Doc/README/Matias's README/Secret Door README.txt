The Secret Door is a way to teleport your player around the play area. 

HOW TO USE:
Place two Secret Doors in your scene some distance apart.
Name each Secret Door with a unique number, i.e. "Secret Door 3", "Secret Door 100"
For each door, enter the number of the desired destination door into the field "Room ID"
Now when a player interacts with a door, they will be taken to the destination door requested.
