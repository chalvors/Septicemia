-== HOW TO USE ==-
This enemy is meant for tests only. It does not have any damage or pathfinding capabilities, it simply moves upward.
This can be used to complete boundary tests.

For instance, in my code I created an enemy spawner and spawned test enemies rapidly within a confined space to test the limits on how many enemies can spawn before the physics breaks in Unity.

To change how fast the enemy moves, edit the maxSpeed in the file or in the inspector.
