 * health - players current health
 * Alive - indicates if the player has died
 * stats - used for wrapping with the decorator
 * playerDamage - audio clip that plays upon dying
 * healthBar - component that syncs ui healthbar with player health
 * gameOverScreen - used to pull up the game over screen when dying
 * animator - the animator for the player
 * delay - the delay between attacks
 * attackBlocked - used to prevent the player from attacking if the delay has not passed
 * circleOrigin - origin of player attack circle collider
 * radius - radius of the player attack circle collider
 * BaseEnemy - enemy type for attacking
 * BaseBoss - ''
 * PistolEnemy - ''
 * RifleEnemy - ''
 * inSecretRoom - bool to stop enemies from spawning if player in secret room
 * DrBCMode - bool that if true makes player invincible
